# Git Kata: Git-Flow feature

In this kata you will have to create a hotfix.

## Setup

Run `./setup.sh`.

## The task

1. Switch into the `exercise` directory if necessary!
1. Get an overview of what is there!
1. Have a look at mouse.txt! It seams that there is a bug that need to be fixed. Use git-flow to open a hotfix!
1. Fix the bug in the hotfix branch!
1. Do not forget to bump the version to 1.2!
1. Create the 1.2 release by closing the hotfix!
1. After you've finished the hotfix there are unmerged pathes in the develop branch. Have a look a the file mouse.txt! What happened?
1. Now that you've solved the merge conflict have a look at the git log! Is the tag 1.2 set correctly?
1. Delete the tag 1.2 with git tag -d 1.2 and set it to the newest commit in main!
